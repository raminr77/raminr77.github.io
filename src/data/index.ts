  ABOUT_ME: `Hello, My name is Ramin and I am a software engineer with over 6 years of experience in front-end development. 
  Currently, I work at Boozt Company and, before that I worked at Digikala, a large e-commerce company in Iran, 
  where I collaborate with teams of over 50 people on various projects. 
  For the past 2 years, I have been a part of the refactor team at Digikala, 
  where I have had the opportunity to redesign and refactor two of the largest e-commerce websites in Iran using React and Next. 
  Through this experience, I have honed my skills in front-end development and gained expertise in creating high-quality user interfaces. 
  In addition to front-end development, I am also familiar with back-end technologies like Python and PHP, which has allowed me to contribute to full-stack projects and understand the larger picture of software development. 
  Outside of work, I am an avid tennis player and workout enthusiast. 
  I enjoy learning new things in my field, whether it's exploring new front-end technologies or improving my back-end skills. 
  I also value spending time with my friends and building strong relationships with my colleagues and teammates. 
  Overall, I am a dedicated and fast-learning individual who is passionate about creating high-quality software and collaborating with others. 
  Thank you for considering me for this opportunity.`,
