      You meet Ramin, a <strong>software engineer</strong> with <strong>over 6 years</strong> of experience in web development. <br />With a strong focus on front-end and familiarity with back-end technologies. <br />
      Proudly I contributed to large-scale projects within the <strong>Digikala Group</strong>. These projects have <strong>over 10 million</strong> daily visits and <strong>over 40 million</strong> users. <br />
      The story of these exciting projects continues and now I am working at <strong>Boozt</strong> company.<br />
      I really believe that nothing is more important and exciting than learning and teaching web-based technologies and there is still so much for me to learn.
