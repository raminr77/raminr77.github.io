## Introduction

A code review isn’t just about finding bugs — its main goal is **continuously improving code quality**.  
A good code review should help you:

- Catch performance and security issues before release.
- Improve readability and maintainability.
- Keep team standards consistent.
- Prevent repeating the same mistakes.
- Share knowledge across the team.

In this post, inspired by the Neo Kim + CodeRabbit checklist and enhanced with process-oriented best practices, we’ll walk through a **complete** and **practical** approach you can apply in your projects.

## 🛠 Pre-Review Best Practices

Before you start reviewing someone’s code, set yourself up for success.

### 1. Understand the Context

- Read the PR description, linked issues, and related documentation.
- Understand **why** this change was made, not just **what** was changed.

### 2. Self-Review (For Authors)

- Review your own PR before asking others.
- Remove unnecessary changes, debug code, and commented-out blocks.
- Ensure tests pass locally.

### 3. Keep PRs Small

- Smaller PRs are easier to review thoroughly and faster to merge.
- If possible, break large features into smaller, reviewable chunks.

## 1️⃣ Functionality & Correctness

Ensures the code does exactly what it’s supposed to.

**Checklist:**

- **Requirements:** Does the code fulfill all feature and business requirements?
- **Logic:** Works for all expected inputs, including edge cases.

```ts
// Correct
if (user && user.isAdmin) { ... }

// Risky - may throw if user is null
if (user.isAdmin) { ... }
```

- **Integration:** Works without breaking existing features.
- **Testing:**
  - All unit tests pass.
  - Integration tests run successfully with real or mocked data.
- **Edge Cases:** Null, undefined, empty arrays, large datasets, unusual scenarios handled.

## 2️⃣ Readability & Clarity

Readable code is easier to maintain and less prone to bugs.

**Checklist:**

- **Clarity:** Easy to read and understand.
- **Naming:** Variables, functions, and classes have meaningful, descriptive names.

```ts
// Bad
const a = getData();

// Good
const userProfile = getUserProfile();
```

- **Style:** Consistent formatting (Prettier, ESLint, etc.).
- **Comments:** Explain “why” the code exists, not just “what” it does.
- **Documentation:** Updated and correct, especially for new APIs or modules.

## 3️⃣ Performance & Efficiency

Performance matters in every project.

**Checklist:**

- **Algorithms:** Use efficient algorithms and data structures.

```ts
// Bad - O(n^2)
arr.forEach(a => arr.forEach(b => { ... }));

// Good - O(n)
const set = new Set(arr);
```

- **Scalability:** Efficient with growing data size or user base.
- **Bottlenecks:** Avoid repeated computations or unnecessary operations.
- **Reuse:** Avoid code duplication; use shared functions/modules.
- **Resources:** Optimize CPU and memory usage.
- **Caching:** Reuse results to speed things up where appropriate.
- **Compatibility:** Works across supported browsers, devices, and platforms.

## 4️⃣ Security & Stability

Security should never be skipped.

**Checklist:**

- **Validation:** Sanitize and validate all inputs.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Guard against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and similar.
- **Data:** Handle sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII) securely.
- **Error Handling:** Fail gracefully with clear, logged errors.

```ts
try {
  await processPayment();
} catch (err) {
  logger.error(err);
  throw new PaymentFailedError();
}
```

- **Observability:** Sufficient logging and monitoring in place.
- **Compatibility:** Works with older versions or required environments.
- **API Design:** Consistent, predictable, and easy to use.
- **Dependencies:** Use only safe and necessary libraries, updated to secure versions.

## 💬 Code Review Process Tips

### Focus on Critical Issues First

Prioritize bugs, security risks, and performance issues before nitpicks.

### Use a Constructive Tone

- Suggest improvements, don’t demand them.
- Use phrases like “What do you think about…?” or “Could we consider…?”

### Be Specific

Link to documentation, examples, or patterns that support your feedback.

### Follow Up

- After changes, verify all issues are resolved.
- Make sure no new issues have been introduced.

## 📋 Quick PR Review Checklist

A short version for quick checks in pull requests:

- [ ] Meets requirements without breaking existing features
- [ ] Clear and consistent naming, style, and documentation
- [ ] Efficient algorithms and resource usage
- [ ] Scalable and free of performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Secure input handling and data protection
- [ ] Proper error handling and observability in place
- [ ] PR is small, focused, and well-documented

## Conclusion

A good code review isn’t a **bug hunt competition**.  
It’s an opportunity for **team learning, quality improvement, and building trust in the codebase**.

> Remember: Code reviews are about progress, not perfection.
