Modern web apps often rely on **client-side routing** to create fast, responsive experiences. However, one challenge remains: ensuring **smooth visual transitions** between pages or views without relying on heavy libraries or frameworks.

With the **View Transitions API**, now supported in Chromium-based browsers, you can animate DOM changes natively ‚Äî offering sleek visual feedback with minimal code.

## ‚ú® What is the View Transitions API?

The View Transitions API enables **animated transitions between different DOM states**. Whether you're navigating between routes or toggling views in a single-page application (SPA), this API lets you animate the shift between ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù states.

> ‚úÖ Unlike traditional CSS transitions, this API handles **DOM updates and animations together** in a well-defined sequence.

## üß† When to Use It

The API is especially useful for:
- Navigating between routes in SPAs
- Showing/hiding sections or modals
- Tab-based navigation
- Complex layout state changes

For multi-page apps, the browser automatically captures the before/after snapshots. But for same-document navigation (e.g., SPAs), you **manually define** the DOM update within the transition.

## üîß Basic Implementation Example

Let‚Äôs build a minimal example with two views: `Home` and `About`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>View Transitions Example</title>
  <style>
    main {
      view-transition-name: main;
    }

    ::view-transition-old(main),
    ::view-transition-new(main) {
      animation-duration: 0.4s;
      animation-timing-function: ease;
    }

    ::view-transition-old(main) {
      animation-name: fade-out;
    }

    ::view-transition-new(main) {
      animation-name: fade-in;
    }

    @keyframes fade-in {
      from { opacity: 0; }
      to { opacity: 1; }
    }

    @keyframes fade-out {
      from { opacity: 1; }
      to { opacity: 0; }
    }

    nav {
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <nav>
    <button onclick="navigate('home')">Home</button>
    <button onclick="navigate('about')">About</button>
  </nav>

  <main id="content">Welcome to the homepage.</main>

  <script>
    const pages = {
      home: 'Welcome to the homepage.',
      about: 'This is the about page.'
    };

    function navigate(page) {
      const content = document.getElementById('content');

      if (!document.startViewTransition) {
        content.textContent = pages[page];
        return;
      }

      document.startViewTransition(() => {
        content.textContent = pages[page];
      });
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## üì¶ How It Works

1. We assign a `view-transition-name` to the `main` element.
2. We define animations using `@keyframes` for both the old and new views.
3. On button click, we call `document.startViewTransition()` and update the DOM inside it.
4. The browser handles the transition between the two visual states smoothly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Browser Support

This feature currently works in **Chromium-based browsers** like Chrome and Edge. For unsupported browsers, the fallback logic ensures the content is still updated ‚Äî just without animation.

You can check for support like this:

```js
if ('startViewTransition' in document) {
  // Safe to use the API
}
```
