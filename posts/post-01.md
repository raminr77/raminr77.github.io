description: On my birthday, I decided to give my personal website a full redesign and rebuild. Using the latest features in Next.js 15, I created a cleaner, faster, and more modern place to share my work and experience. It was both a fresh start and a great way to explore what this amazing framework can do.

It all started when I looked at my old website and realized it no longer showed who I am today. I wanted something simple, modern, and professional, a website that matched how I build things now. With the latest version of Next.js and React, I used tools like server-side rendering, dynamic routing, and performance tweaks to make the site fast and reliable.

I also redesigned how the content was organized. Now, my projects, experience, and certificates are easier to find and understand at a glance. I made sure the site looks great on any screen, whether it’s a phone or a big monitor.

This wasn’t just another coding task, it was a personal project that reminded me why I love building things from scratch. By the end, I had a website that truly feels like me: clean, fast, and focused on what matters most.

## Stay tuned
